# AlphaDraughts

AlphaDraughts is a PyTorch implementation of [AlphaGo Zero][alphago_zero] applied to the game of Draughts. \
Draughts, or Checkers, is a far easier game to solve compared to Go, and even to Chess: it has an 8x8 playing board, 
but only two types of pieces. Additionally, Draughts has been [weakly solved][solved_games]. This means that Draughts
should present less of a burden to train than AlphaGo (although just how much less is to be determined).

### How to run
The logic for the game is currently being implemented. There is nothing to run yet.
